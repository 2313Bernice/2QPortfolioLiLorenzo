      <h1> Nation of Mondstadt </hi>
        <h2> About Mondstadt: </h2>
        <p> Known as the City of Freedom, Mondstadt is located at the northeast of Teyvat. The wind carries the scent of dandelion, the whispers of
            songs and a gentle tune all from the Anemo Archon, Barbatos, who watches over the children of his nation. Mondstadt is known not only for 
            it's warm breeze, but is reknowned for it's delicious and tantalizing wine.
        </p>
        <h2> Mondstadt's Lore: </h2>
        <p> Mondstadt is protected not only by it's Archon, but by an order of knights called the Knights of Favonius- founded by Vanessa with the help of Barbatos 1000 years 
            ago to prevent the corrupt rule of aristrocats. The head of the knights is Grand Master Varka, who is currently on an expedition along with other knights. Overseeing
            the knights in his steed is Acting Grand Master Jean, the Dandelion Knight.
