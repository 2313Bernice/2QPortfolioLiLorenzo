        <h2> Mondstadt and Its Archon: </h2>
        <p> 
            Known as the City of Freedom, Mondstadt is located at the northeast of Teyvat. The wind carries the scent of dandelion, the whispers of
            songs and a gentle tune all from the Anemo Archon, Barbatos, who watches over the children of his nation. Once a mere formless wind spirit,
            Barbatos gained power from the people of Old Mondstadt during the war against a tyrant king called Decarabian. Soon enough, the wind spirit
            ascended to godhood and became the Anemo Archon of current Mondstadt. Mondstadt is known not only for its warm breeze, but is renowned for its 
            delicious and tantalizing wine. Along with traditional and lively festivals such as the Windblume Festival, Ludi Harpastum, and Weinlesefest-
            Mondstadt truly is a nation of freedom.

        <h2> Mondstadt's Lore and History: </h2>
        <p> Mondstadt is protected not only by its Archon, but by an order of knights called the Knights of Favonius (K.o.F)- founded by the heroine Vanessa with the blessing 
            of Barbatos with the goal of stopping the corrupt rule of aristocrats during that era. The current head of the knights is Grand Master Varka, who is currently
            on an expedition along with other knights beyond Mondstadt's walls. Overseeing the knights in his stead is Acting Grand Master Jean, the Dandelion Knight and 
            the Lion of the South. The Lion of the South is one out of the Four Winds of Mondstadt, four entities entrusted by Barbatos to keep the nation safe long ago.
            These entities are Dvalin (Dragon of the East), Boreas (Wolf of the North), Vanessa (Falcon of the West), and Jean (current Lion of the South).

           <br> <br> Long before the current Mondstadt, a tyrant king and the former archon called Decarabian ruled over Old Mondstadt (the Mondstadt before Barbatos's rule). The lands were once cold and harsh,
            leading to Decarabian creating a powerful wind barrier that surrounds the old city to protect his people. While this prevents the harsh conditions 
            from entering and affecting his people, it also meant no one can leave. With this confinement along with Decarabian's corrupt rule, it led to his people viewing him with contempt.
            Urged by their oppression, Mondstadt's oppressed yet courageous people alongside Decarabian's own lover, Amos, fought to overturn the tyrant king. Among the few survivors of the rebellion
            was a wind spirit, who took on the physical form of a nameless bard who had passed away in the battle. This wind spirit is who we now know as Barbatos, who later ascends
            to godhood and became the current Anemo Archon. Using his powers, he blew away the snow and ice from the land and established a new Mondstadt. Yet unlike 
            Decarabian, he chose to fully embrace freedom and left his people to independently govern the nation. After long periods of corrupt aristocracy (ex. The rule of the Lawrence Clan),
            as well as eras of peace such as the establishment of the Knights of Favonius, all these events lead to the present-day Mondstadt.
